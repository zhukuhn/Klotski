Guideline 3.1.1 - Business - Payments - In-App Purchase


The app offers in-app purchases that can be restored but does not include a "Restore Purchases" feature to allow users to restore the previously purchased in-app purchases.

Next Steps

To restore previously purchased in-app purchase products, it would be appropriate to provide a distinct "Restore" button and initiate the restore process when the "Restore" button is tapped by the user. Note that automatically restoring purchases on launch will not resolve this issue.
